# Stage 5 — Claude Code Ecosystem ⭐⭐

> [繁體中文](./05-claude-code-ecosystem.md) | [简体中文](./05-claude-code-ecosystem.zh-Hans.md) | **English**


⏱ **Time estimate**: 3-4 weeks (~15-25 hours)

> 💡 This stage revolves around four terms (**MCP / Skills / Plugins / Marketplace**) → unfamiliar? See [`resources/glossary.en.md` §5](../resources/glossary.en.md#5-claude-code-ecosystem).

> 📌 **This stage is used by both tracks**:
> - **Track A (CLI Power User)**: A2 uses [5.1 (Claude Code basics)](#51--claude-code-basics); A3 uses [5.2 (MCP)](#52--mcp-model-context-protocol-foundation) + selectively [5.3 (Skills)](#53--skills-claude-code-behavior-layer) and [5.4 (Plugins)](#54--plugins--marketplaces) (A3's Exercise CLI-12 teaches packaging CLAUDE.md / commands into a plugin). Reading angle: "**how to use Claude Code well**"
> - **Track B (Agent Builder)**: works through the full stage 5.1 → 5.4 as "**how Claude Code works internally**" deep dive

> ⚠️ **This stage is not the path for a local LLM.** Claude Code requires Anthropic API / OAuth and cannot directly switch to Ollama or a local endpoint. For offline work, privacy-sensitive files, or avoiding API quota, use [`resources/cookbook.md` Recipe 6](../resources/cookbook.en.md#6-local-llm--cli-agent-quick-walkthrough) with a BYO-LLM CLI agent such as OpenCode / goose / Aider / Hermes.

## Stack at a glance

Top to bottom, each layer is built on the one below:

![Claude Code Ecosystem Stack](../resources/diagrams/stage5-stack.en.png)

Each layer adds one capability:
- **API + SDK**: programmatic access to the LLM
- **Tool Use**: LLM can call functions you define
- **MCP**: standardized protocol so any LLM host can use any tool server
- **Skills**: behavior bundles for Claude Code that can wrap MCP tools
- **Plugins**: package + ship Skills, hooks, commands, MCP configs as one unit

This stage has 4 sub-sections. **Do them in order** — each builds on the previous.

```
5.1  Claude Code Basics       3-5 days   (install, slash commands, CLAUDE.md)
5.2  MCP — Protocol Layer     5-7 days   (write your first MCP server)
5.3  Skills — Behavior Layer  5-7 days   (write your first SKILL.md)
5.4  Plugins & Marketplaces   5-7 days   (package and ship)
```

After this stage you will be able to extend Claude Code, write your own MCP server, and ship a plugin marketplace.

## 5.4 — Plugins & Marketplaces

### Learning Goals
- `plugin.json` schema (name, version, skills array, configuration)
- `marketplace.json` schema (plugins array, source, metadata)
- `claude plugin marketplace add` workflow
- Distinguish single-plugin bundle vs multi-plugin marketplace
- Publish your own marketplace

### Required Reading
1. [**Anthropic — Plugins documentation**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins)
2. **Read the `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` of 2-3 marketplaces below**

### Hands-on Exercises
- **Exercise: plugin install** — install one of the marketplaces below, see it load
- **Exercise: plugin.json** — package the SKILL.md you wrote in 5.3 into a plugin
- **Exercise: marketplace publish** — push to GitHub, install via `claude plugin marketplace add`

### Curated Projects

> 💡 **Want to see how others package plugins?** Several entries in [`resources/mcp-skills-catalog.en.md`](../resources/mcp-skills-catalog.en.md) (dev collab / design / monitoring sections) ship as plugins too (e.g., `timescale/pg-aiguide` is both an MCP server and a plugin). The section below stays focused on "**marketplace structure templates**" as reference.

#### [anthropics/claude-plugins-official](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official) ⭐ Official

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Stars | ★ 18k+ |
| License | NOASSERTION (each plugin has its own license; check per plugin) |
| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: Anthropic's official marketplace template — `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` standard schema, `plugins/` for inline plugins, and `external_plugins/` for plugins referenced from external repos.

**Best for**: Before publishing your own marketplace, this is the official template you'd most want to copy from for the **what should marketplace.json look like?** question.

**Notes**: Beyond schema, this also shows how Anthropic categorizes its official plugins (chrome-devtools, deepwiki, code-research, jam, etc.).

---

#### [obra/superpowers-marketplace](https://github.com/obra/superpowers-marketplace)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Stars | ★ 900+ |
| License | MIT |
| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: **The minimal marketplace template** — the repo contains only `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + README; the plugin source itself lives in external repos. Demonstrates the **curator-only marketplace** form (the curator selects, doesn't bundle source).

**Best for**: Building a "I curate, others write" marketplace. Smaller than `anthropics/claude-plugins-official` — the minimum viable template.

---

#### [trailofbits/skills-curated](https://github.com/trailofbits/skills-curated)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Stars | ★ 388 |
| License | CC-BY-SA-4.0 |
| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: A curated marketplace from the well-known security firm Trail of Bits, focused on **supply-chain security** — every skill is reviewed, and the README documents the criteria.

**Best for**: Reviewers and teams who care about supply-chain trust and want to study the **curator-vouches-for-safety** model.

**Notes**: Small in scale but significant in framing — shows that a marketplace can be more than a list, it can be a trust mechanism.

---

#### [anthropics/life-sciences](https://github.com/anthropics/life-sciences) (domain-specialized example)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Stars | ★ 331 |
| License | NOASSERTION (marketplace itself has no SPDX; each MCP server is licensed by its own provider) |
| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**What it teaches**: Anthropic's own **domain-specialized marketplace** example (for life sciences / health) — shows how to tailor `marketplace.json` for a single vertical instead of a generic catalog.

**Best for**: Builders making vertical-specific marketplaces (healthcare, finance, legal, edu) who want to see how Anthropic handles it.

**Notes**: Payload is bio-leaning MCP servers, but the marketplace.json shape is the actual lesson.

---

> **"How to publish your own marketplace" tutorial is still missing** — the most reliable resource is currently [Anthropic's official plugin docs](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins). Have you written a high-quality walkthrough? PRs welcome.

---

#### [rohitg00/awesome-claude-code-toolkit](https://github.com/rohitg00/awesome-claude-code-toolkit)

| Recommendation | ⭐⭐⭐ |
|---|---|

**What it teaches**: One of the largest community catalogs of Claude Code agents, skills, hooks, and templates. Wide breadth across many use cases.

**Best for**: After Exercise 3, browse to see what's out there.
