# Stage 6 — Memory · RAG · Advanced

> [繁體中文](./06-memory-rag.md) | **English**


⏱ **Time estimate**: 2 weeks (~10 hours)

> 💡 This stage is term-heavy (**RAG / vector DB / embedding / chunking / hybrid search / reranking / …**) → if any are unfamiliar, check [`resources/glossary.en.md` §3](../resources/glossary.en.md#3-memory--retrieval--rag) first.

Agents that don't remember past interactions are not useful. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is the standard approach. This stage covers both.

## 📌 Learning Goals

- Distinguish short-term, long-term, episodic, semantic memory
- Understand vector embeddings and similarity search
- Build a basic RAG pipeline (chunk → embed → store → retrieve → generate)
- Recognize when RAG is the wrong answer (and when it's the right one)

## 🧩 How to Think About Chunking

Good chunking lets an LLM generate from the most precise and complete information that fits inside a limited context window. It is not just splitting text into equal pieces. It depends on the application and document type, and it defines the smallest semantic unit your retriever can see.

A good chunk does two things at once: it is **complete enough** for the model to understand context, and **focused enough** for retrieval to avoid noise. Chunks that are too small lose context. Chunks that are too large make similarity search less precise.

Common strategies:

- **Fixed-Length**: split by character or token count. Simple and stable, but rigid enough to cut through paragraphs, sentences, or tables.
- **Sliding Window**: keep overlapping spans between chunks. This reduces boundary loss, but increases index size.
- **Recursive**: try to keep paragraphs first. If the length still does not fit, fall back to sentences, words, or smaller units. A good baseline for beginner RAG apps.
- **Semantic Chunking**: split by embedding distance or semantic shifts. In practice, this means splitting when the current chunk and previous chunk become semantically different. Useful for long documents, but more costly and complex.
- **Hybrid**: choose and combine strategies based on the application and document structure. For example, a paper may need to preserve sections, tables, formulas, and citation context.

![Chunking strategy flow](../resources/diagrams/chunking-strategies.jpg)

For your first RAG app, do not start with a clever splitter. LangChain docs recommend starting with `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` for most use cases, then using retrieval results to decide whether to change strategy.

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text = "This is a long document... (imagine many more words here) ..."

splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=100,
    chunk_overlap=20,
    length_function=len,
)

chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
print(f"Split into {len(chunks)} chunks")
print(chunks[0])
```

Two quick signals tell you whether chunking is off:

- The answer misses information, or starts in the middle of an idea: chunks may be too small, or overlap may be too low.
- The answer contains the right information plus unrelated details: chunks may be too large, or top-k may be too high.

Advanced chunking questions:

- Chunking is not a one-time setting. Tune it against real queries and failure cases.
- Chunk size, overlap, top-k, and reranking affect each other. Do not inspect only one parameter.
- Think about mixed data types: if your RAG source includes image-heavy PDFs and meeting transcripts, how should the chunking strategy change?

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises (do them, not just read)

### Exercise 1: Embeddings
Embed 100 sentences, find nearest neighbors of one query. Build intuition for what "vector distance" means.

### Exercise 2: Vector DB
Store embeddings in Chroma, query semantically. Compare against keyword search.

### Exercise 3: Chunking comparison
Take one document and split it three ways: fixed-size chunks, paragraph chunks, and heading-aware chunks. Use 5 real questions to compare top-k results, and note which strategy retrieves the right context more reliably.

### Exercise 4: Full RAG pipeline
Chunk a PDF → embed → retrieve top-k → generate answer. The basic skeleton most RAG apps use.

### Exercise 5: Long-term memory
Give an agent conversational memory across multiple sessions. Use `mem0` or roll your own with a vector store.
